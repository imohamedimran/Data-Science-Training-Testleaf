3. Definitions:
       Machine learning : if you replace a machine with expert system [expert person]. This can be achieved by giving quality and good number of information [history of events/samples] to machine algorithm. 
                          Example: analyzing a x-ray [only doctor with more practice can only do . Hence it is exper job]
       AI               : if you repalce a common human being[ activity] with machine then AI. 
                           Example: Driving a car with machine [here dring is common human activity which can be replaced,]
                           Example: chat bot
       Statistics : 
       Deep Learning :  it is tool to achive AI
       ADS   : Aanlytical Data set [preprocessed data. i.e ready for analyis for feeding for machine learning models]
       EDA   : Exploratory Data Analysis [This analysis will be done post cleaning, EDA will help to understand data trend to decide which ML model to be used for higher accurate results]
       CV    : Co-efficient of Variation. Used find the how good or bad each data is. low value good, i.e less stddev, more value is bad, stddev is bad

Mean : when no outliers. mean will get affected by ourliers. sensitive to outliers
Medien: when we have outliers. median will not affected by ouliers more. robust to outliers.

left skewed distribuation we used to get : mode, median, mean in the left to right order
                                  exmple: run rates as of cricket match : 5 5 5 5  6 8 9 10 16 10 9

if we know the business, we can explain in stddev, if we don't know teh deviation, then we can go with CV [co-efficient of varidaiton] : [s/x]*100    ; s - stddev, x = mean

stdeg value for example 2 min response time or 2 rupees, this may not understand by everyone, suppose USA people may not know rupeees, hence we can say in co-efficient/percentage of variation.
